# AI-Assisted Development Course Instructions

This repository contains HTML presentations for the SoftUni course "AI-Assisted Development with GitHub Copilot" (January 2026).

## Project Structure
- All content files are in the `AI-Assisted Development with GitHub Copilot/` directory
- Each lesson is a standalone HTML file with embedded CSS
- Files are named with a number prefix (e.g., `01-topic.html`) for ordering

## Content Creation Guidelines
- Each HTML file should be a self-contained presentation about VS Code features or AI development tools
- Include modern CSS styling with gradients, cards, and responsive design
- Add links to official VS Code documentation and resources
- Mention the AI model used to generate the content in a note at the bottom
- Keep content educational and focused on practical VS Code usage

## Key Patterns
- Use semantic HTML with header, main, footer sections
- Implement card-based layouts for features and tips
- Include keyboard shortcuts tables where relevant
- Add call-to-action links to VS Code marketplace or docs

## Development Workflow
- Edit HTML files directly in VS Code
- Preview by opening in browser (no build required)
- Maintain consistent styling across lessons while allowing creative variations

## Examples
- See existing files like `01-vs-code-about-gpt-5-2.html` for structure reference
- Each file demonstrates different AI-generated approaches to the same topic
