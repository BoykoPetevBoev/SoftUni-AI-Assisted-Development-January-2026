# UI Design, Styling, and SCSS Refactor Prompt

## Objective
Improve the UI design and styling of the application using SCSS while keeping functionality unchanged.

---

## Step 1 – Analyze Current UI
- Review existing components and layouts
- Identify missing, inconsistent, or poorly structured styles
- Identify elements without semantic or reusable CSS classes

---

## Step 2 – SCSS Refactoring and Styling

Refactor and improve styles by:

- Creating clear, reusable SCSS class names
- Applying consistent spacing, typography, and colors
- Improving layout using Flexbox/Grid where appropriate
- Organizing SCSS files logically (base, layout, components, pages)
- Removing inline styles and anti-patterns
- Ensuring styles are responsive and visually balanced

Attach appropriate CSS/SCSS classes to JSX/HTML elements as needed.

---

## Step 3 – Design Standards Enforcement

Ensure:
- Consistent naming conventions for classes
- Separation of structure and styling
- No inline or hardcoded styles
- SCSS variables used for colors, spacing, fonts
- Components are visually consistent across pages

---

## Step 4 – Verification

- Application runs successfully after styling changes
- No layout-breaking issues
- No visual regressions that affect usability
- Storybook (if present) renders components correctly

---

## Reporting
- List modified SCSS/CSS files
- List updated components with new or changed class names
- Summarize design and styling improvements
