# Prompt: Update Server API README for Frontend Usage

Context:
This repository contains a Exam-Budget-Tracker-App/server API.
The main README.md inside the `Exam-Budget-Tracker-App/server` folder is used by frontend engineers
to understand available endpoints and expected data.

Task:
Update the server API README.md to accurately reflect the current API.

Goals:
- Make it easy for a frontend engineer to consume the API
- Be explicit and predictable
- Avoid backend-only implementation details

Instructions:
1. Update the list of available endpoints
2. For each endpoint include:
   - HTTP method
   - URL path
   - Short description
   - Request body (if applicable)
   - Response example
3. Provide mock JSON data that frontend developers can use immediately
4. Keep examples realistic but simple

Formatting rules:
- Use Markdown
- Use clear section headers
- Use fenced code blocks for JSON
- Prefer tables where helpful

Assumptions:
- API is REST-based
- Responses are JSON
- Authentication (if any) should be clearly stated

Output:
Return the full updated README.md content.
Do NOT include explanations outside the README.
