# Core Coding Rules
- Preserve existing behavior unless a change is explicitly approved; call out risks.
- Optimize for readability: simple control flow, meaningful names, and comments that capture intent or constraints—not restating the code.
- Keep functions cohesive and small; extract helpers when branching grows or repetition appears.
- Match the surrounding style and patterns already in the file before introducing new ones.
- Fail loudly and early: validate inputs, handle null/undefined, and surface errors instead of swallowing them.
- Prefer small, incremental changes paired with tests or manual checks when logic shifts.
